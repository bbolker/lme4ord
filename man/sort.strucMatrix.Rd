\title{Sort the indices of a structured sparse matrix}
\usage{
\method{sort}{strucMatrix}(x, decreasing = FALSE, type = c("col", "row",
  "val"), ...)

standardSort(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{\link{strucMatrix}} object}

\item{decreasing}{see \code{\link{sort}}}

\item{type}{sort by column, row, or value indices?}

\item{...}{for consistency with generic}
}
\description{
The ordering of the indices is arbitrary, but some orders are more
computationally efficient than others in certain circumstances.
\code{standardSort} is defined as \code{sort(sort(., type =
"row"), type = "col")}, which is often the 'best' order.  It is
used throughout, and in particular is required for using the
\code{\link{kr}} function.
